# TileFix
A small graphics mod for Duke Nukem 3D, aiming to beautify the game. Free to use for any purpose, including use in mods for Duke Nukem 3D or other games. I only ask that you give credit where it is due.

# Credits
All tiles are edited or otherwise created by Jimmy Gnosis, based off of original tiles created by 3D Realms except for:

21 (pistol pickup) - Sprite dumped from voxel created by ReaperMan  
2524-2526 (pistol idle and firing) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
2531 (reloading pistol magazine) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
2544 (RPG idle frame) - I believe this tile might have been made Fox, or if not, by myself with help from Hendricks266. I can't remember.  
2570-2572 (pipebomb detonator) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
3413-3415 (fire truck) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  

# Construction
Editors Used: Adobe Photoshop CS6, MeeSoft's Image Analyzer, IrfanView, LibreSprite, BAFEd, EditArt
Construction Time: TileFix officially began development in April of 2025. Some of these tiles I edited in the past ten years or so.
Known Bugs/Problems: May introduce graphical issues with user maps that contain creative texture or sprite work. It should not introduce issues to the base game.
