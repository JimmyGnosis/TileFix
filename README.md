# TileFix
A small graphics mod for Duke Nukem 3D, aiming to beautify and enhance the game. The project has entailed cleaning up dirty coloring/stray pixels, extending screen tiles horizontally for widescreen compatibility, extending some screen tiles vertically to provide extra cover for screenbob, creating missing animation frames for back rotations, etc. Some small liberties have been taken here or there, but fit within the scope of the game's vision. For some tiles, there are optional alternate versions closer to the original art. This mod is free to use for any purpose, including use in mods for Duke Nukem 3D or other games. I only ask that you give credit where it is due.

# Credits

21 (pistol pickup) - Sprite dumped from voxel created by ReaperMan

2531 (reloading pistol magazine) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
2544 (RPG idle frame) - Based off tile from the aborted Hail to the King port, I believe made by Fox.

# Construction
Editors Used: Adobe Photoshop CS6, MeeSoft's Image Analyzer, IrfanView, LibreSprite, BAFEd, EditArt  
Construction Time: TileFix officially began development in April of 2025. Some of these tiles I edited in the past ten years or so.  
Known Bugs/Problems: May introduce graphical issues with user maps that contain creative texture or sprite work. It should not introduce issues to the base game.
