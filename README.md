# TileFix

A small graphics mod for Duke Nukem 3D, aiming to beautify and enhance the game. The project has entailed cleaning up dirty coloring/stray pixels, extending screen tiles horizontally for widescreen compatibility, extending some screen tiles vertically to provide extra cover for screenbob, creating missing animation frames for back rotations, etc.



This mod is free to use for any purpose, including use in mods for Duke Nukem 3D or other games. I only ask that you give credit where it is due.

# Credits

All tiles are edited or otherwise created by Jimmy Gnosis, based off of original tiles created by 3D Realms/etc except for:



21 (pistol pickup) - Sprite dumped from voxel created by ReaperMan  
2524-2526 (pistol idle and firing) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
2531 (reloading pistol magazine) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
2544 (RPG idle frame) - Based off tile from the aborted Hail to the King port, I believe made by Fox. Some elements recreated from LameDuke tile.
2570-2572 (pipebomb detonator) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom  
3413-3415 (fire truck) - Contains some graphics from Duke Nukem 64 created by Eurocom



Big thanks to everyone in the Duke4.net community, without whom this project would not have been possible. The extent of knowledge and ability to find information among it's members are invaluable and contributed greatly to this project.

# Construction

Editors Used: Adobe Photoshop CS6, MeeSoft's Image Analyzer, IrfanView, LibreSprite, BAFEd, EditArt, Magica Voxel, Qubicle
Construction Time: TileFix officially began development in April of 2025. Some of these tiles I edited in the past ten years or so.  
Known Bugs/Problems: May introduce graphical issues with user maps that contain creative texture or sprite work. It should not introduce issues to the base game.

# Installation \& Notes

Interestingly, during the course of doing this I found that some textures from LameDuke actually had better color depth than textures that ended up in the final game. Retaining or increasing color depth in all edits was a high priority. Included are many .PSDs mostly for those that are curious or "exploitables" so that it is easier for others to create edits. Many of these exploitables saved me time fixing multiple similar tiles. Some small liberties have been taken here or there, mostly logic fixes that fit within the scope of the game's vision. For some tiles, there are optional alternate versions closer to the original art or extraneous edits that would be useful to mappers/modders.
